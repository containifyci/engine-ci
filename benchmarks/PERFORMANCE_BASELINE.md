**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Commit**: 5799229  
**System**: Apple M1 Pro, Darwin 23.0.0, Go 1.24.2  
**CPU Cores**: 8  

This document establishes the performance baseline for the engine-ci project to support Issue #196 performance optimization efforts.

## üéØ Performance Targets

Based on the identified bottlenecks, we're targeting these improvements:

- **Container Operations**: 25-40% reduction in operation time
- **Log Aggregation**: 30-50% reduction in memory usage for large builds  
- **String Operations**: 60% reduction in allocations
- **Container Runtime Management**: 2-3x improvement in concurrent throughput

## üìä Current Performance Baseline

### Container Operations (`pkg/container/container.go`)

### String Operations (`pkg/container/build.go`)

| Operation | Current Performance | Memory Usage | Allocations |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **AsFlags String Building** | 742.3 ns/op | 1,664 B/op | 2 allocs/op |
| **ImageURI Construction** | 140.7 ns/op | 112 B/op | 2 allocs/op |
| **CustomString Operations** | 1,472 ns/op | 112 B/op | 6 allocs/op |
| **BuildType String Ops** | 3.3 ns/op | 0 B/op | 0 allocs/op |
| **EnvType String Ops** | 2.9 ns/op | 0 B/op | 0 allocs/op |

**Key Insights:**
- üö® **AsFlags String Building** uses 1.6KB memory - target for 60% allocation reduction
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ImageURI Construction** could be optimized to reduce allocations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CustomString Operations** has 6 allocations per operation
- ‚úÖ **Type String Operations** are already optimized
