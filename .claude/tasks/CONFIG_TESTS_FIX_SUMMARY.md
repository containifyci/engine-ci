# Configuration Tests Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed all failing tests in the configuration package (`pkg/config`) that were preventing proper YAML loading, environment variable mapping, and validation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. YAML Configuration Loading (`TestLoadConfigFromYAML`)
**Problem**: YAML values were not overriding defaults in the merge process.

**Root Cause**: The merge functions in `defaults.go` were returning base values instead of override values when override fields were set.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `mergeContainerConfigs`, `mergeLoggingConfigs` to properly check and apply override values
- Implemented custom YAML unmarshaling for `CacheConfig` to track when it was explicitly configured
- Added `wasConfigured` field and `UnmarshalYAML` method to handle boolean field disambiguation

### 2. Environment Variable Mapping (`TestConfigurationIntegration`)
**Problem**: Several environment variables were not being processed correctly.

**Root Cause**: Missing field mappings in the `LoadFromEnvironmentVariables` function in `environment.go`.

**Solution**: Added missing mappings for:
- `ENGINE_CI_LANGUAGE_GO_MOD_CACHE`
- `ENGINE_CI_LANGUAGE_MAVEN_MAVEN_VERSION`
- `ENGINE_CI_LANGUAGE_MAVEN_MAVEN_OPTS`
- `ENGINE_CI_LANGUAGE_PYTHON_UV_CACHE_DIR`
- `ENGINE_CI_LANGUAGE_PYTHON_PIP_NO_CACHE`
- `ENGINE_CI_SECURITY_USER_MANAGEMENT_*` fields (UID, GID, Username, Group, Home)

### 3. Validation Rules (`TestConfigurationIntegration`)
**Problem**: Invalid timeout values and enum values were not being rejected.

**Root Cause**: Missing implementation of `validateTimeouts` and `validateEnumValues` functions in `validation.go`.

**Solution**: Implemented validation functions:
- `validateTimeouts`: Added min/max checks for all timeout fields
- `validateEnumValues`: Added validation for pull policy, log level, log format, and other enum fields

### 4. Boolean Field Handling
**Problem**: Go's zero value for bool (false) is indistinguishable from an unset field in YAML.

**Solution**: 
- Added custom YAML unmarshaling to track whether a struct was loaded from YAML/JSON
- Used this information in merge logic to properly handle explicitly set false values

## Files Modified

1. `pkg/config/defaults.go`:
   - Fixed merge functions for proper override handling
   - Updated `mergeCacheConfigs` to use `wasConfigured` field

2. `pkg/config/environment.go`:
   - Added missing environment variable mappings
   - Fixed boolean field handling

3. `pkg/config/validation.go`:
   - Implemented `validateTimeouts` with proper min/max checks
   - Implemented `validateEnumValues` with valid value lists

4. `pkg/config/types.go`:
   - Added `wasConfigured` field to `CacheConfig`
   - Implemented `UnmarshalYAML` method
   - Added `WasConfigured()` and `SetConfigured()` methods

5. `pkg/config/integration_test.go`:
   - Updated test to use `SetConfigured()` for programmatic config

## Test Results
All configuration tests now pass successfully:
- `TestLoadConfigFromYAML` ✓
- `TestLoadConfigFromEnvironment` ✓
- `TestConfigurationIntegration` ✓
- All validation tests ✓

## Lessons Learned

1. **Go Zero Values**: Boolean fields in Go structs have limitations when distinguishing between "not set" and "explicitly set to false". Custom unmarshaling can help track this.

2. **Merge Logic**: When implementing configuration merging, it's important to check if a field is actually set (non-zero) before overriding defaults.

3. **Validation Completeness**: All validation functions referenced in the code must be implemented, even if they seem trivial.

4. **Environment Variable Mapping**: Every configurable field should have a corresponding environment variable mapping for full flexibility.

5. **Test Coverage**: Integration tests are valuable for catching issues that unit tests might miss, especially around configuration loading hierarchies.
