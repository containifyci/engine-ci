# Memory Optimization Improvements Implementation Plan

## Overview

Based on the performance baseline analysis, I need to implement memory optimization improvements to address critical bottlenecks in the engine-ci project. The main focus areas are:

1. **üö® Checksum Computation** (652ms) - Major bottleneck requiring streaming hash implementation
2. **üö® Specialized Build Creation** (122ms, 177 allocs) - Needs filesystem operation optimization  
3. **‚ö†Ô∏è AsFlags String Building** (1.6KB allocations) - Requires pre-allocated string builders
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Service Build Creation** (41ms, 59 allocs) - Cache filesystem operations needed

## Target Performance Improvements

- **Container Operations**: 25-40% reduction in operation time
- **Memory Usage**: 30-50% reduction in memory usage for large builds  
- **String Operations**: 60% reduction in allocations
- **Container Runtime Management**: 2-3x improvement in concurrent throughput

## Implementation Tasks

**Components**:
1. **String Builder Pool** - Reusable string.Builder instances with size estimation
2. **Buffer Pool** - Reusable byte buffers for I/O operations
3. **Hash Buffer Pool** - Specialized buffers for checksum computation
4. **Memory Tracker** - Performance tracking and metrics collection

### Task 2: Optimize Checksum Computation (Priority: Critical) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Target**: Reduce from 652ms to <200ms (70% improvement)
