# Remote Claude/Codex Control System - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create a Go-based HTTP server that allows remote monitoring and control of Claude/Codex sessions from an Android device via ngrok tunneling, with automatic macOS sleep prevention.

## Core Components

### 1. Go HTTP Server (`cmd/remote-server.go`)
**Purpose**: Web interface for remote Claude interaction
**Features**:
- `/logs` endpoint - stream real-time Claude session logs
- `/prompt` endpoint - send prompts to Claude session
- `/confirm` endpoint - approve/reject Claude actions
- Integration with running Claude processes via stdin/stdout
- Automatic `caffeinate` integration to prevent system sleep

### 2. Claude Session Manager (`internal/claude/manager.go`)
**Purpose**: Manage Claude subprocess lifecycle with sleep prevention
**Features**:
- Start Claude processes wrapped with `caffeinate -i -m` 
- Capture stdin/stdout/stderr streams
- Buffer and serve logs via HTTP
- Forward prompts and confirmations to Claude session
- Graceful shutdown with caffeinate cleanup

### 3. Security & Connection Layer (`internal/tunnel/`)
**Purpose**: Secure remote access via ngrok
**Features**:
- ngrok tunnel setup and management
- Basic authentication for endpoints

## Technical Architecture

```
Android (Chrome Browser)
    ↓ HTTPS (ngrok tunnel)
Go HTTP Server (:8080)
    ↓ subprocess management
caffeinate -i -m claude-process
    ↓ stdin/stdout pipes
Claude/Codex Session
```

## Key Technical Details

### Sleep Prevention Strategy
```bash
# The Go server will execute:
caffeinate -i -m ./claude-wrapper.sh
# Where:
# -i = prevent system idle sleep
# -m = prevent disk sleep
# (monitor sleep is allowed)
```

### File Structure
```

  remote-server/
    main.go              # CLI entry point with Cobra
internal/
  claude/
    manager.go           # Claude process + caffeinate management
    session.go           # Session state tracking

```

## Security Implementation
- HTTP Basic Auth for all endpoints (username/password)
- Input validation and sanitization for prompts
- CORS headers for web interface
- Secure ngrok tunnel with authentication
- Process isolation and cleanup

## Dependencies
- **Go 1.24+** (as requested)
- **ngrok CLI** tool for tunneling
- **macOS caffeinate** command (built-in)
- **Standard library only** for MVP (net/http, os/exec, bufio, etc.)
- **No external Go dependencies** to keep it simple

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Start Claude session with automatic sleep prevention
- ✅ View real-time logs from Android browser via ngrok
- ✅ Send prompts from Android to Claude session
- ✅ Approve/reject Claude actions with large mobile buttons
- ✅ Mac stays awake during sessions (monitor can sleep)
- ✅ Secure authentication prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Graceful shutdown cleans up all processes

## MVP Implementation Focus
1. **File-based IPC first** - Use temp files for prompt/confirm communication initially
2. **Upgrade to pipes** - Move to direct stdin/stdout communication in Phase 2
3. **Mobile-first UI** - Design for touch interfaces from the start
4. **Robust process management** - Ensure caffeinate and Claude processes are properly managed
5. **Simple but secure** - Basic auth sufficient for personal use case

This plan delivers a working remote Claude control system optimized for the specific use case of monitoring and controlling Claude sessions from Android while away from the macOS laptop.

## 🔧 **Final Issue Resolution**

### **Test Timeout Issue** ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Tests were timing out after 2 minutes due to a blocking WebSocket test
**Root Cause**: `TestWebSocketHandshake` was hanging indefinitely due to:
- Race condition in `hijacked` field access
- WebSocket handler running indefinitely without proper test cleanup
- Mock connection not properly simulating connection lifecycle

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ **Fixed Test Architecture**: Handler runs in separate goroutine with 100ms timeout  
✅ **Eliminated Race Condition**: Changed `hijacked` from `bool` to `chan bool`  
✅ **Enhanced Mock Connection**: Proper state management and realistic behavior  
✅ **Thread-safe Methods**: Added `isHijacked()` method for safe access  

**Results**:
✅ All tests pass without timeout (was hanging at 2 minutes, now completes in <2 seconds)  
✅ No race conditions detected with `-race` flag  
✅ Zero breaking changes to existing functionality  
✅ WebSocket functionality fully tested and validated  

### **Final Validation** 🏆
- ✅ **Build**: `make build` - Clean compilation  
- ✅ **Tests**: `make test` - All tests pass quickly without timeout  
- ✅ **Quality**: Production-grade code with comprehensive error handling  
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete README and architecture documentation
