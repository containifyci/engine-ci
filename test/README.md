- Memory leak detection: < 1MB increase over 1000 operations

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
Tests are designed to work in GitHub Actions environments:
- No external dependencies required for unit/integration tests
- Docker-dependent tests are skipped in CI (marked with build tags)
- Performance tests have appropriate timeouts
- Coverage reports are generated

### Make Target Integration
Tests integrate with existing build system:
```bash
# Run tests as part of quality gates
make test

# Run tests with formatting and linting
make fmt lint test

# Generate coverage reports
make test-coverage
```

## Test Best Practices

### Test Structure
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Use testify for assertions and mocking
- Create temporary directories for file system tests
- Mock external dependencies for reliability

### Test Isolation
- Tests are independent and can run in parallel
- Use t.TempDir() for temporary directories
- Clean up resources in defer statements
- Avoid global state modifications

### Error Testing
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Validate error messages are helpful
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure graceful degradation

### Performance Testing
- Include benchmarks for critical paths
- Test concurrent access patterns
- Monitor memory usage and leaks
- Validate against performance baselines

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures in CI
- Ensure tests don't depend on local file system paths
- Use appropriate timeouts for CI environments
- Mock external dependencies
- Check for race conditions in concurrent tests

#### Performance Test Failures
- Performance tests may be sensitive to system load
- Run multiple times to get consistent results
- Adjust thresholds for different environments
- Monitor for memory leaks in long-running tests

#### Configuration Test Failures
- Environment variables may persist between tests
- Use defer statements to clean up environment
- Test configuration hierarchy carefully
- Validate file permissions for config files

### Debugging Tips

#### Verbose Test Output
```bash
# Run with verbose output to see detailed logs
go test -v ./...

# Run specific test with debug output
go test -v ./pkg/config -run "TestConfigurationHierarchy"
```

#### Test Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Check coverage for specific packages
go test -coverprofile=config_coverage.out ./pkg/config
go tool cover -func=config_coverage.out
```

#### Memory Profiling
```bash
# Run tests with memory profiling
go test -memprofile=mem.prof ./test/performance
go tool pprof mem.prof
```

#### Race Condition Detection
```bash
# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
2. Use testify for assertions and mocking
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Add performance tests for new critical paths
5. Update this documentation

### Test Naming Conventions
- Test functions: `TestFeatureName`
- Subtests: `t.Run("specific_case", func(t *testing.T) {...})`
- Benchmarks: `BenchmarkOperationName`
- Examples: `ExampleFunctionName`

### Test Documentation
